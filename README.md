# Cascade
Is a model encoder-decoder, the encoder represents a single RNR and decoder is a sequence of RNRs that progressively build a prediction context by trusting each other and each managing a word position in the dialog utterances. The final context is thus based as much on the words as the statements preceding the answer to be predicted.
